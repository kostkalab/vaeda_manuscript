# vaeda

vaeda (variaitonal auto-encoder (vae) for doublet annotation (da)) is a computational tool for doublet annotation in single cell RNA-sequencing. 

This is the code and results underlying our manuscript XXXX.

To install the python package vaeda, see the package's [github](https://github.com/kostkalab/vaeda) for installation instructions.

Code to produce vaeda's results can be found in the dirrectory notebooks. Code for benchmarking results can be found in the dirrectory called R. Code to reproduce main figures can be found in the diffectory figures. The environment used to produce these results is available in vaeda_env.yaml. Lastly, doublet scores and calls calculated in this manuscript are available in results_benchmark.zip and results_downsample_cells.zip.
